  inputs. In the fields below `B` denotes the batch dimension, `N` represents
  the number of nodes in the tree, and `num_actions` is the number of discrete
  actions.

  node_visits: `[B, N]` the visit counts for each node.
  raw_values: `[B, N]` the raw value for each node.
  node_values: `[B, N]` the cumulative search value for each node.
  parents: `[B, N]` the node index for the parents for each node.
  action_from_parent: `[B, N]` action to take from the parent to reach each
    node.
  children_index: `[B, N, num_actions]` the node index of the children for each
    action.
  children_prior_logits: `[B, N, num_actions` the action prior logits of each
    node.
  children_visits: `[B, N, num_actions]` the visit counts for children for
    each action.
  children_rewards: `[B, N, num_actions]` the immediate reward for each action.
  children_discounts: `[B, N, num_actions]` the discount between the
    `children_rewards` and the `children_values`.
  children_values: `[B, N, num_actions]` the value of the next node after the
    action.
  embeddings: `[B, N, ...]` the state embeddings of each node.
  root_invalid_actions: `[B, num_actions]` a mask with invalid actions at the
    root. In the mask, invalid actions have ones, and valid actions have zeros.
  extra_data: `[B, ...]` extra data passed to the search.
